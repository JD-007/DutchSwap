Introduction
------------

To buy or sell tokens with Dutch Swap, you'll need an Ethereum wallet. The most commonly supported wallet is Metamask.

.. note:: You can read more about metamask here: https://metamask.io/

Below you can see some examples of how you can use metamask.

Metamask
========

Download and install Metamask into your browser

MetaMask is just an Ethereum Browser and Ether wallet. It interacts with Ethereum Dapps and Smart Contracts without running a full Ethereum node. MetaMask add-on can be installed on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and the new Brave browser. It also allows you to store and transfer ERC20 tokens.

* First, let’s setup MetaMask in the Chrome browser.
* Open up your browser and go to https://metamask.io/.  For security reasons, make sure the URL is correct in your browser. 
* Go to “Install Metamask for your browser”, this should take you to the extension store. 
* Then click on ‘ADD TO CHROME’ to install the MetaMask Plugin
* After installing, click on the MetaMask icon on the top right corner of the chrome browser. It will open up MetaMask UI, scroll all the way down and click Accept to agree MetaMask’s terms of use.
* Then enter a password, confirm the password, and then click Create for a new Ethereum account. This account allows you to send and receive Ether, ERC20 tokens, and also allows you to deploy Smart Contracts 

------------

* Now after setting up your password, MetaMask will now show you a 12-word recovery key (Seed) as below. This is the only way to recover your tokens so be sure to write them down correctly.
* These 12 words are the only way to restore MetaMask accounts if you forget the password. It should be stored in a safe location, such as in a notebook or USB key kept in a safe. Then click on 
* ‘I’VE COPIED IT SOMEWHERE SAFE’. The main screen of MetaMask will open as below.
* That’s it you’ve just created a new Ethereum address using MetaMask! Your address can be found by clicking on the three little black dots and clicking “Copy Address to clipboard”.
* To use the Test network, Ropsten, we’ll select the Main network and change that to Ropsten
